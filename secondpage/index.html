        <h1>Introduction To Programming</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>C programming is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs as a successor to the B programming language. Initially, C was used for developing the UNIX operating system, which is still widely used today. Over time, C has become a popular language for developing system-level software, embedded systems, and other applications. </p>

    <p>C is a compiled language, which means that the source code is first compiled into machine code, which can then be executed directly by the computer. This makes C programs fast and efficient, which is one of the reasons it is still popular today.
<br><br>
        C is also a low-level language, which means that it provides low-level access to the computer's hardware, such as memory management and system resources. This makes it a powerful language for writing system-level code and is why it is used to develop operating systems and other low-level applications.</p>
        
        
        <h2>What is C Programming?</h2>
        <p>The C programming language is a procedural, general-purpose language that is independent of the operating system and facilitates structured programming. It also offers low-level access to the system memory. The C programming language was created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at AT&T (then known as Bell Laboratory), where it was used with the UNIX operating system on a DEC PDP II. Additionally, it was Ken Thompson's B programming language's successor. C was created to address the issues that BASIC, B, and BPCL programming languages had. C surpassed all other programming languages for mainframes, microcomputers, and minicomputers by 1980.</p>

        <h2>Why Learn C?</h2>
<p>The primary benefit of learning C over assembly is the ease and speed with which one can develop code for a particular programming task. Compared to writing it in assembly, using C will require significantly fewer lines of code, finish the task much faster, and require far less mental work. Additionally, executable files created using today's modern compilers will often execute faster than those created "by hand" using assembly language.

    The portability of C is another great benefit. The instruction sets of different processors vary. It is a difficult task to have to rewrite and maintain assembly code for every computer architecture you desire to run your code on. As a result, one of C's key advantages is that it combines portability and universality across different computer architectures.</p>
    
    <h2>What are Constants <br> and Variables?</h2>
    <p>C is a programming language that allows the use of constants and variables. Constants are values that cannot be changed during program execution, while variables are values that can be changed during program execution. Let's know more about them.

    <h2>Constants in C</h2>
<p>Constants are values that are fixed and cannot be changed during program execution. In C, constants can be of different types, including integer, floating-point, and character constants. We use the “const” keyword to declare constants in C </p>
<br>
<p>There are two types of constants in C:</p>
<ul class="list1">
    <li>Numeric Constants: Numeric constants represent a fixed value and can be either integers or floating-point numbers.</li>
    <li>Character Constants: Character constants represent a single character enclosed within single quotes (' ').</li>
</ul>
